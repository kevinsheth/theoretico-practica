Theology is to be both theoretical and practical. At least, that is how it ought to be. The Reformed tradition has a rich history of balancing theory and practice in such a way that strengthens and encourages Christians to be faithful disciples of Christ in whatever vocation He has called them to. This website is an attempt to positively contribute to the Church with helpful articles and resources rooted in the Reformed tradition, particularly its 16th and 17th century expression, that it might continue that pattern of strengthening and encouraging Christians through theoretical-practical theology.
